# thefactory-modeltrainer — implementation plan

Remaining work only. What's built and how it fits: `docs/architecture.md`. The contract:
`docs/model-training-standard.md`. The core loop (Phases 0–7) is **built + verified**: the
engine, backend activities, viewer, remote runner, and three conformant consumers —
`examples/cartpole`, `examples/tabular`, and **BlackSwan** (`/Users/cloud/Documents/Work/BlackSwan`,
the trading line, Phase 7 done). The engine stays domain-oblivious so any further model is
_data + the thin CLI contract_, not engine code. What's below is optional phases, small
cleanups, and deferred new work.

## Repo split (governs all phases)

| Repo                                    | Owns                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **thefactory-modeltrainer** (this repo) | `ModelTrainerTools`; matrix planner; campaign loop; judge/propose orchestration; the viewer; the standard + `examples/`.                                       |
| **thefactory-tools**                    | Generic infra only: `ComputeRunner` seam (+ future `RemoteComputeRunner`, `ContentAddressedDataCache`, `RunnerCredentialEntry` pairing); the work-item engine. |
| **thefactory-backend**                  | Activity registration + composition; app-view serving; future PIN-pairing endpoints + runner WS channel.                                                       |
| **clients**                             | Future Compute Runners settings/pairing screen (native, cross-project); everything else reused.                                                                |
| **the runner agent**                    | Future Docker-packaged connect-out program. Home decided in Phase 6.                                                                                           |
| **BlackSwan** (the trading repo)        | Its `TrainerManifest` + additive `trainer/` CLI conformance (Phase 7, done). No Overseer code.                                                                 |

## Phase 8 (optional) — Autopilot + live handoff

Scheduled meta-activity (propose → run → judge → promote, human-approved); on a winner, tag
the checkpoint for the live trading handoff (`run_server_model.py`).

## Phase 9 — Jupyter notebooks: run/view/edit `.ipynb` — **UNDERSCOPED**

View/edit/execute notebooks belonging to a training project from the Overseer. No spec yet —
parked until the core loop ships. To scope: render-vs-edit depth, where the kernel executes
(backend host / sandbox / remote runner), how notebooks read campaign records/artifacts,
security (notebook execution = arbitrary code; likely the sandbox profile). Do not build
preemptively.

---

## Carried-over cleanups (small, no phase dependency)

- App-nav unseen badge: the Overseer App tab already spins on a live activity, but an
  unseen-results badge while idle needs app→host plumbing (the embedded app reports its unseen
  count). The in-app unseen badges cover the immediate need.

### Considered and declined (so they aren't re-raised)

- `RecommendTools.buildProductCatalog` → `runActivityWorkItems` migration: **not a real
  duplicate.** Recommend's loop is the richer of the two — it streams mid-supplier progress
  (`gathering`→`done`), carries a `supplierStates` map, and absorbs a gather failure as
  "done-but-failed" instead of throwing; the generic engine only emits
  `{done,total,skipped,failed}` per completed item. Forcing the migration would be a
  behaviour-changing downgrade for ~10 lines saved.

### Deferred to after Phase 9

- Runner-channel WebSocket upgrade: deferred, not dropped. Job dispatch is already effectively
  instant (the channel `wake()`s a waiting long-poll the moment a job is enqueued); a WS would
  only shave the agent's ~1.5s log-batch latency, and raw runner logs aren't surfaced in the
  viewer today — so the win is currently invisible. Revisit when a live-log UI exists to consume
  it.
- Remote git repoRefs: the runner agent clones but assumes a self-bootstrapping checkout; the
  engine still emits local paths only. Wire git refs + project bootstrap when a real remote
  machine needs it (BlackSwan local path covers Phase 7).

---

## Open verification (BlackSwan-improvements round)

The round shipped — all seven improvements (seed plumbing, parallel-runs concurrency,
data-visibility `asset` lever + `dataset` descriptor, the price-action `runChart` + custom per-run
UI, lean run-health, the dip/regression line as a second hub project, the `quickStart` preset).
The Python paths and the engine/backend changes are verified by real runs + unit tests. One pass
remains: run the hub **embedded in Overseer** and confirm the viewer additions render live — the
custom price-action chart + dataset badge in run detail, the "Max concurrent runs" control, the
"Quick start" button, and registering the dip line as a second project (same repo, manifest file
`.factory/trainer-dip.json`). Build + typecheck + tests passing is not the same as a live embed.

### Deferred (consciously, from this round)

- **Full RL resume** — per-episode RL checkpointing + `set_env` continuation for true mid-training
  resume. Lean run-health shipped (a failed run is recorded + re-dispatched, and the regression
  line resumes from its per-episode checkpoint), but the RL trading line still restarts from zero.
  Revisit if mid-run RL continuation is worth the training-loop surgery.
- **True multi-asset** — only BTCUSDT has 1d/1h klines, so the `asset` lever is BTC-only today.
  The lever + per-symbol globs + `data_inventory` capability gating are root-cause-correct; altcoin
  1d/1h backfill is the data mine's job, after which the lever expands with no code change.

## Future path & UX scrutiny (after the BlackSwan improvements above)

**Massive scrutinisation task and critical look to decide on the future path for the project, as
well as UI/UX usability improvements.** Once the improvements above land and there are real
multi-asset / multi-timeframe results to read, step back and look hard at the actual run data:
judge whether the current experiment design, objective, and levers are the right ones, and
propose the next campaigns to run — expect this may force big changes to how experiments are run.
Pair it with a usability pass over the hub app and the per-run result UI.

## The data mine — a shared dataset project for every model trainer

A standalone project (its own repo, e.g. `thefactory-datamine`) that is the **source of truth
for training data** across all ModelTrainer consumers: gather raw data (exchange klines for
BlackSwan, datasets for the tabular/code lines, …), clean + validate + normalise it, and
publish it in the best shape the models can consume — versioned and reproducible. Each trainer
project then declares which prepared dataset(s) it needs (the manifest's `data[]` already names
them) and the data mine + the content-addressed cache deliver them; no trainer fetches or
cleans raw data itself. This is where the user's separate dataset repo for BlackSwan folds in
(the current klines are likely stale). Deferred until the core loop + BlackSwan improvements
are in — but it's the natural home for "prepare the data correctly so the models have it in the
best form," and it makes the remote-runner data path (Phase 6 cache + `data[]` + `credentialRef`)
pull from one curated origin.

## Code-change risk model — the second workspace ML tool (deferred)

A trainer-conformant project that scores an agent's diff/PR by how likely it is to introduce a
bug (later reverted/fixed, or CI-failing) — a calibrated risk signal the platform uses to gate
review effort, trigger an expert-panel/verifier pass, and flag risky agent output before merge.
A genuinely different third consumer shape (calibrated binary classification, AUC/precision
objective) that hardens the generic engine, and it makes the agents measurably safer.

**Deferred — gathering the labelled data is the hard part, so the FIRST step is research, not
code:**

1. **Research (do this first).** Survey existing public datasets before mining our own — this is
   likely language-specific (academic just-in-time defect-prediction corpora skew Java; JS/TS is
   thinner). Look at e.g. ApacheJIT, Defectors, JIT-Defect4J, ManySStuBs4J, CVEfixes, Big-Vul,
   Devign, CodeXGLUE defect-detection. Decide: bootstrap the model on an existing dataset
   (faster, transferable) vs mine our own from the workspace git histories (in-domain, but needs
   labeling). Use the deep-research harness; output a short cited report + a go/no-go on a
   workspace-mined dataset.
2. **Data (via the data mine).** If mining our own: an SZZ-style labeling pass over the
   `thefactory-*` git histories — commits later reverted or bug-fixed = positive; features from
   codeIntel (churn, files/complexity touched, test coverage of touched code, diff size). This is
   the data mine's first real job. Versioned, reproducible `(features, label)` records.
3. **Train.** A `risk-classifier` trainer-conformant project (its own `.factory/trainer.json`,
   sklearn or torch, objective = AUC or precision-at-k, health flags for class collapse), the
   `data[]` naming the prepared dataset. Register in the hub exactly like BlackSwan.
4. **Consume.** Wire the score into the review / expert-panel / verifier path (a risk badge on a
   diff; gate the expensive panel on high risk).

Depends on the data mine; pick up after the BlackSwan improvements.

## Open questions (deferred — decisions to make when their dependency lands)

- **Remote artifact/checkpoint storage** — keep-on-runner + reference vs upload; how a winning
  remote checkpoint reaches the live trading server. _Deferred because_ it only has meaning once
  remote runs **and** the live-trading handoff (Phase 8) both exist; deciding now would be
  deciding in a vacuum. Revisit when a remote campaign produces a checkpoint someone needs
  elsewhere. (Phase 6/8.)
- **GPU + sandbox profile for training images** — `--read-only` rootfs vs ML caches; `--gpus`
  is wired in SandboxTools but unexercised. _Deferred because_ it isn't on the active path: the
  runner agent runs jobs directly (`spawnStreamingCommand`), **not** through the Docker-sandboxed
  `SandboxTools`, so there's no rootfs/GPU profile to exercise until a Docker-sandboxed runner is
  real. Revisit if/when training runs inside the sandbox image. (Phase 6/7.)
- **Judge/proposer model transport** — `ModelSelection` (API vs CLI). _Deferred because_ it's
  being overtaken by the in-flight `ModelSelection` refactor (the activity ctx now carries
  `model: ModelSelection`, and `ModelSelection` gained a `cli` member); resolving it means
  finishing that refactor's CLI inference path. Revisit once the CLI inference stage lands — until
  then judge/propose run on API. (Phase 5.)
